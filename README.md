### How to use jQuery DataTables to display database records

jQuery DataTables is a very valuable plugin that can be used when displaying records fetched from a database. It includes several functions that are useful. Without this plugin, we will have to implement those functions from scratch. This plugin makes our work easy. It provides us search function, pagination and counting records for us. Only need to link and insert the jQuery code to use this.

1. Download or clone the project and rename it as **jQuery-DataTables** or any other.
2. Run XAMPP or WAMP and go to "http://localhost/phpmyadmin".
3. Create a new database in PhpMyadmin called **ajax_search**.
4. Import the SQL file included in project folder.
5. Place the project folder in your localhost. (htdocs or www folder)
6. Open the browser and enter the URL for the project. URL for the project as - "http://localhost/jQuery-DataTables".
